It is made up of four assets.   Three of the assets represent data which was prepared for the project and which is sufficient  to reproduce the tables from the paper.  The remaining asset is a 1M row sample of the 1B raw dataset of twitter impressions. This is included to help the data scientist understand how the other three datasets were created.  If you would like for us to take the time to ETL the 1B raw dataset and load it into this node, reach out via the contact details and we'd be happy to do so.
